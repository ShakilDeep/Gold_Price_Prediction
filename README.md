Gold price prediction using machine learning involves using historical data on gold prices and various machine learning algorithms to forecast future gold prices. Python, being a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning, is often utilized in such projects.

By applying machine learning techniques, such as regression, time series analysis, or deep learning, to historical gold price data, models can be trained to learn patterns and relationships in the data. These models can then be used to make predictions or forecasts on future gold prices.
